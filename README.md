### Running the program ###
Please run the setup.bat the first time you use the program. After that, run it by running the "run_Reel.bat" file or double-clicking the corresponding short-cut.  
If the program does not open, check that the path to python.exe in "run_Reel.bat" line 5 is valid.

Files are opened from *Files->Open* by selected the desired files in the dialog box. **NB:** The file order might depend on the sorting order of the current folder!
Open several datasets by clicking the *Add dataset* button, and change between them by clicking their names, the *Next* or *Previous* buttons, or with ctrl+arrow keys.

"Reel" through frames by dragging the green lines, either in the *Surface* plots or in the *Parameter* plot, or by using the arrow keys.

Select which parameters to plot and which axis to plot them on in the *Parameter plot* menu.

You can change the user defined default settings by editing the *ReelUserSettings.py* file, and restore the default settings from the *Help* menu in Reel.

### Data formats ###
Reel accepts several common data formats, but for the full range of option, use the *.xyy* format, as described in the *Reel1.0 Quick Guide.pdf*.
